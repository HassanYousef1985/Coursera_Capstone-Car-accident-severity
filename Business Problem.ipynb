Wouldn\u2019t it be great to be able to understand what are the most common causes, in order to prevent them from happening? With this analysis, I am attempting to understand these factors and their correlation. This analysis has multiple applications like an app that will prompt the drivers to be more careful depending on the weather and road conditions on any given day or a way for the police to enforce more safety protocols. In this instance, I am using the data from the City of Seattle\u2019s police department showing all the collisions from 2004 till present."
